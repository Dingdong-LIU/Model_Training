"Yes, you would.
Wait, how dare I answer for you?  Sure, I can answer for myself, I have been in them many times, from several different teams.  But I've also watched other people in them, and seen the results of research at Stanford testing how people react to them.
And the research shows people are amazingly trusting of them.   One might even say disturbingly trusting, since all the vehicles today are prototypes which are not rated safe enough to be sold to ""civilians.""   People trust them more than the engineers building them would trust them, more than they should.   In the Stanford research, they made a fake self-driving car which was actually being driven by the ""observer"" in the back seat with hidden controls.   They simulated the vehicle having a system failure and needing immediate take-over.  Even after the failure, subjects were happy to push the button to re-engage when told to by the observer, and they would pick up their newspaper and read again.
So while yes, you may personally believe you would not get in one, and might even be right about yourself, the reality is huge numbers of people are ready to trust the vehicles, and a few positive experiences make them even more willing.  And that's before they are actually ready, and are always operated with safety drivers ready to handle any problem.     In truth, even people who say they would not be willing to trust it seem often to change their minds, so you might even be wrong about yourself when you say you would not ride it.
Would you get into a self-driving elevator?  Some day people will think this question is similar to that.","Yes, you would.

"Its a no brainer for the following reasons:
I can make use of the time I spend driving. I spend almost 2 hrs a day driving back and forth from work, or just picking up people. So i can basically send my car to airport to pick up friends or family, the car can drop me to work and go back home or pickup kids.I am a bad driver, been into a few fender benders and my insurance is expected to get sky-high. No driving means I don't have to worry about insurance, even license for that instance. I cannot get a ticket or DUI problem. I don't have to worry about falling asleep on the wheel when I am driving late in the night or making a road trip. I can do what I want. Finding parking is a pain in the cities. Especially when I am running late for the meetings, I spend at least 20 min finding parking spots and then walking all the way back to the office. At the least, I can take calls, attend meetings or even watch movies while driving.
Initially the investment might be big, but the ROI is pretty awesome and worth it.
Only problem will exist when I am running late to work and there is a traffic problem, however if everyone is driving a robotics car, i hope there would be no accidents to cause delays.","Its a no brainer for the following reasons

"You already do. It is called ""taxi"".
Yes, taxi self-driving uses a human component. That component can be  good, or mad, drunk or outright violent. However, it looks like everyone is using taxis, and so are you.
Self-driving cars without human component should be more consistent, so on day 2 or 3 of availability you will get in without thinking.","You already do. It is called ""taxi"""
"I already have. However, I did have the luxury of building most of it myself, and writing all the control and planning algorithms.
When a startup uses its own product they call it 'dogfooding'. When a Ph.D. student takes a ride in his own robotic vehicle, they tend to call it 'gross breach of operational health and safety regulations'.","I already have

"I would. However, I admit that, since I don't offer a proper explanation, some here would classify me as a zealot. They would not be wrong. In order to reach a non-emotional answer it might help to ask a different question: ""Would you put your child in a self-driving car?"". Or, ""if you had the choice of driving your mother to the airport personally, or putting her in a self-driving car, which would you chose?""
Here's my answer: watch the insurance rates. If/when the insurance on a self-driving car is less that the insurance for you, personally, driving then the self-driving car becomes the logical choice.
I expect that to happen.","I would. However, I admit that, since I don't offer a proper explanation, some here would classify me as a zealot."
"Absolutely.
I've been following along with the Google Cars news for quite a while now, and am anxiously awaiting the day they're available on the market.",Absolutely.
"This is not something I want to be an early adopter with.
I don’t trust them.
I have seen how the electronics industry is constantly awash in unpredicted failures and collapses with every major upgrade or added function. Software companies rarely see people die due to limited ability to control secondary consequences. Self-driving cars with AI programs are another story.I know that the lifetime of mechanical auto parts, the problems of proper manufacture and improper installation, and the assembly of complex machines like automobiles, makes unpredicted failures of all cars’ mechanical parts inevitable. The electronics can’t eliminate this.I know that many parts have variable lifetimes and are subject to road hazards, including tires and brakes. This won’t change.Humans are adaptable and daily react to noises, sights, smells and other stimuli. Computers won’t recognize these warnings, and vehicle failures will occur, causing increases in accidents (at least for some time).The environment outside the vehicle, and sudden intrusions upon the roads, will never be 100% predictable, or foreseen and neutralized by programmers. You can’t change this. Improving predictions by computers will take time, trial and error.
I know better than to trust these systems, and I know they will be buggy at the beginning and with every change.
Here’s the problem. It doesn’t matter whether I trust them if they are widely adopted.
It may be that it will become apparent that a similar vehicle to the other self-driving ones will rapidly become safer to ride in than to buck the trend and depend on human choices that surprise the artificial reasoning.
There will be no escape, and it’s almost here.
Boy, will there be some human disasters of unprecedented fury, numbers, terror and carnage you and I will (if lucky) get to hear about in the news.",I don’t trust them
"A properly working one that can drive well? Yeah, I would.
Tell this then where to go, and then take a nap while it gets there.
It is like having your personal driver at all times.
—edit—
If you look up death statistics in car crashes and breakdown of the reasons. Typical reasons are: Distracted driving, driving under influence, speeding, running red lights, reckless driving.
A machine won’t every do any of it. It won’t get distracted, get drunk, etc. And it won’t ever get tired. Also, it will be your own personal driver in a box.
So, in the long term self-driving car will be a safer choice.","A properly working one that can drive well? Yeah, I would.

"Yes, and I fly in airplanes that fly themselves. We’ve trusted autopilot for decades and it has become more sophisticated over time. I would absolutely buy a car that drives itself. It is and will be even safer as the number of them increase.
When the next generation of vehicle to vehicle communications happens so that the control unit has knowledge of what is happening in the vehicles around it, we will wonder how we ever trusted ourselves on the road.",I would absolutely buy a car that drives itself
"I plan to buy one as soon as the price gets in the range of the regular models.
I doubt that will happen in my lifetime, but you never know.
At one time I said I would never own a vehicle with power windows and now I have two. I wish I didn’t but it has become nearly impossible to find anything else.",you never know
"yes. maybe a slow drive at first just to be sure, but I'm confident about this technological future. Also, it would really free up both hands to flip off other drivers and throw things from the windows. ahhhh progress.",I'm confident about this technological future
"I'd consider it, definitely not straight away though - will wait a few years until everything is 100% safe and secure.
I'm interested in the other projects happening with driverless cars at the moment, such as the Sartre project (http://www.askaprice.com/research/news-analysis/sartre-throws-down-self-drive-gauntlet-to-google-18639.aspx).

"NOI like control.I like vintage motorcycles,Vespas, and sports cars.If there is no stick shift and tachometer, it is not a real car.I drive in places like Brazil and Italy where traffic laws are interpreted liberally.
Using this system I have never been in an accident.The last time I took a taxi I rejected the first one in line.
I find driving fun.A self-driving car is no fun.","NOI like control

"Q: Do you want a car to drive for you?
A: Most of the time, hell yes! There is no pleasure driving in urban traffic. There is no pleasure in sitting in a traffic jam on I95, or jammed on the beltway around Baltimore or Washington DC. Where is the joy trying to jiggle forward to get to the Lincoln Tunnel to NYC.
And when I need to drive from Philly to Boston, there is no pleasure in it. Just cruising along at 75, with traffic all around, on constant lookout for any bad situation is stressful and tiring, not fun.
Now if you give me a chance to drive on a winding road on the way to Santa Cruz, or Half Moon Bay, then driving is real fun.
All in all, I’ll let the car drive 95% of the time, and maybe take the wheel the other 5%.",There is no pleasure driving in urban traffic
"Would you buy a car that drives itself?
No, because I have no desire to go into taxi business, and a personal self-driving car is a huge waste of money — it sits 90% of time when it could be doing something useful, like ferrying passengers.
Would I ride in a car that drives itself? Absolutely. I hate driving, and can’t wait to never have to do it again.
[Edit] Since writing this answer, my wife and I got a Tesla. I use the self-driving mode whenever I can. (It will not switch on in a city.)","Absolutely. I hate driving, and can’t wait to never have to do it again."
"It seems like a reasonable question, but . . . .
Self-driving cars are an aspirational technology, mostly because of the environment that they would have to traverse.
Those of us who are older think of the “Johnny Cab” from Total Recall:
Or, more recently, the cars from the disappointing second season of Westworld:
We would all LOVE to have a fantastic, safe, luxurious living room on wheels that will take us to our destination in style, or let us nap, or watch movies, or whatever.
It sounds GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some of us, like a grumpy-sounding other answerer, love driving and would refuse to give up our autonomy or our perceived sense of control.
Those people are the problem.
What I mean is, autonomous cars would be great, IF THEY WERE THE ONLY CARS OUT THERE.
But they aren’t.
Assholes are real, and they are everywhere.
The utopia of a safe, efficient, fast-flowing, autonomous driving environment is a dystopia to the hordes of self-involved, me-first, freedum-loving drivers who would resist it with every fiber of their being.
And that is a fact. Whether we think it’s wrong or not, and I see both sides of the coin, it will never happen in our lifetimes.
We will NEVER have autonomous driving cars that are fast and efficient because of needed caution around reckless and inattentive drivers, unknown obstacles, and limitations of “artificial intelligence”.
You see, AI is great, but it is fallible, because it exists in a fallible world, and the algorithms that it creates were initially created by humans. And humans are idiots.","It seems like a reasonable question

"Looking forward to it. I love to drive on a nice day with little or no traffic. At all other times, I'll have my car drive for me.",I love to drive on a nice day with little or no traffic
"Yes, but not if it's built by Google.  Their development style is geared toward ""productivity"" and not toward rigorous testing and safety controls.  If they can't make a mobile phone OS that allows me to consistently answer phone calls then how likely is it that their car will be bug free?","Yes, but not if it's built by Google."
"Yes, I will. I'd love to have a chauffer, even if it is a robot. As it has been said, my productivity would be upgraded a lot not having to drive, park, stay in the traffic for tons of hours (and not being able to talk on the phone, use the computer, read...)
I must comment that I rather board a robotic car made by Google to one made by Microsoft or Apple.  At least there would be tons of experts and geniuses....err.. mechanics that can fix it anywhere or, even better, I could plug it (or the car could plug itself) to recharge anywhere.
One curious analogy of this is that currently most of us board commercial planes that are actually flown by a computer, most of the time... specially when flying at high altitude,  leveled flight and over the oceans... and nobody complaints..or maybe they don't even suspect that the pilots are not really driving the plane on many instants during the trip.
But my definite answer is yes, I will.","Yes, I will.

"I hate the idea of a self driving car. I love to drive! I buy cars because I like driving them and look at them as big expensive toys. I find driving to be relaxing and fun. I don’t buy cars just to get me to work and back. That being said, a self driving pickup truck would be helpful at times when I’m towing my off road toys across the country on vacation. 12 hour days behind the wheel is exhausting and that’s something I’d give up. In general though, I’ll keep driving my own cars.",I hate the idea of a self driving car
"Yes.
Currently self-driving cars are as dangerous as an average driver (we can’t have the exact fatality rate per mile driven, because for Tesla a sample size that includes only two fatality is too small, but we have enough data for being sure that it can’t be 10 time more dangerous).
I have already taken a ride with a driver more dangerous than the average driver (somebody with 3 non-lethal accidents during the last 2 years, one of them having leaded to the total destruction of a car).
I am riding a bike. The per-mile fatality of a bike is far above the per-mile fatality of below-average car drivers.",Yes
"Absolutely! Self driving cars are safer, and could even sometimes serve the job of multiple cars, by serving as a taxi of sorts, picking people up, dropping them off, and possibly even recharging all autonomously. It’s an exciting concept.",Absolutely!
"I don't think I could compete with the fleets of self-driving cars to be owned and operated by Waymo, Lyft and Uber.
The days of buying a car costing many thousands of dollars and letting it sit most of the day and all night are coming to an end for all but the rich and foolish. What could be better than having a vehicle that is available on demand that fuels itself, never needs a place to park, and costs only when you need it?
Some may consider driving fun but only sometimes. Highway driving? Mindnumbingly boring. City driving in heavy traffic. That's fun?
Consider traveling long distances straight through without having to overnight in an expensive motel. How about letting the vehicle keep up with stop-and-go traffic while you can be online reading or communicating?
Need a designated driver? Nope. Got a “lead” foot that's cost you moving violations? No more. Worried about having the keys taken away when you grow old and feeble? No problem.
Self-driving cars will be as convenient as having your own chauffeur at the price of public transportation.","I don't think I could compete with the fleets of self-driving cars to be owned and operated by Waymo, Lyft and Uber"
"No, there is NO reason to. I’ll subscribe to a ride share program similar to Uber, that way when I fly to another city I push a button and a car will pick me up curb side. if I own an AV it will be back home doing me no good.","No, there is NO reason to."
"Yes, as soon as they work and are available at a reasonable price.
3 hours commuting a day will encourage you to try anything.","Yes, as soon as they work and are available at a reasonable price."
"Yes, definitely. There is so much tedium and boredom I could avoid if I didn’t have to manually guide the vehicle down the road all the time within the traffic law guidelines.","Yes, definitely."
"Yes! As cars become more expensive, ride sharing/Uber/self driving will become more prevalent. Self driving cars save lives. One million people die/year in vehicle crashes. Even if 50% less people were killed, it would be worth it.",Yes!
"Maybe. It could be nice on long trips, but I enjoy driving and don't know if I would like giving up the control. It is a major trust issue. I know computers fail, lock up, get corrupted, get hacked, and software designers cannot think of every scenario.

"I already do own what will some day (hopefully) become a self-driving car.
But just because I own it, doesn’t mean I would (or would not) use its self driving features.
Is that really your question? Would I use a self-driving car?
If I was in the position of never being near a self-driving car, or one with driver assistance features (like my car currently has), then yes, I would be pretty nervous to ride in a self-driving car if one suddenly plopped down in front of me. At a bare minimum I would want to see a lot of data that shows statistics like how often they are involved in accidents, or probably get a lot of anecdotal stories from friends and other early adopters on how their experiences went.
However, I am lucky enough to be in a position where I have a car (a Tesla Model 3) that has driver assistance features such as adaptive cruise control and lane keeping/changing that are evolving over time, and just like having ridden as a passenger with my teenage sons who were learning to drive, and being quite nervous at times, I’ve had the opportunity to see how the car has gradually improved, while staying alert and ready to take control if needed.","just because I own it, doesn’t mean I would (or would not) use its self driving features"

"I program industrial robots for a living. We test the robot cells in any way we can think of. Bad products, bad sensors, bad air supply. We try running them into and over the safety fence. We try and make them restart themselves, when being reset, or when something goes wrong. We use the sensors we have and the robot movement to scan the work area, before starting to work again. If we cannot deduce what's happening we ask the operator. Despite this. The controlled work area, weeks of testing of a well-known system. The operators find a way to introduce errors we never dreamt off before. Newer have seen before. Not even on the last clone of this system.

I already own a 2019 Tesla with the $8000 autopilot upgrade and it’s more of a novelty with some interesting safety and autonomous features but lightyears away from actual self-driving where you can work or sleep on your commute.

"Absolutely not! People's brains are already on autopilot enough as it is. Getting machines to do our thinking for us is taking humanity down a slippery (and potentialy dangerous) slope, from which there may not be any return...

"For what ?
Haha, so many people answer but don't even take the pain to understand the question. If it is to be driven from point A to B in the same way you be driven by a cab, yes, most people would. When you take the cab, the driver is actually transparent (most of the time).
For enjoying the pleasure of driving... seriously not. Well, that also depends on how you see the car. For example, a mainland chinese will buy a S500 but this is just to be seen in a car not even to enjoy driving such a good car. Unfortunately Mercedes, BMW and all these car maker care more about how much cash they make than about the feeling behind driving their car.
All in all, well, i would still prefer to drive to drive me car on short distance because to me, driving is a pleasure. It's a time during which my brain is forgetting about all other things. I don't see where else i could get this time.
And well, self driving car make little sense, why don't we just focus on more efficiently moving the persons instead of just thinking ok... they gonna have free time so we will make sure they use this time to spend cash or attention on our services.","All in all, well, i would still prefer to drive to drive me car on short distance because to me, driving is a pleasure."

"You mean, like, self-driving car?
Oh, yes, please! I can imagine myself sitting in the front passenger’s seat, either enjoying the view outside, or sit back, lean my seat and have my laptop on, either doing office work, playing or just browsing the net using my mobile hotspot.
I enjoy driving, though. I enjoy driving through traffic jams, I enjoy driving fast on empty road in early morning and late night. But I’d love it for someone - or in this case, something - to drive me around, giving me a chance to do things I can’t do while I’m driving. It feels awesome.

I think the whole idea of cars without people in them driving in public is creepy and kinda weird, like anonymous people on Quora.",I don’t. I value people’s lives more than the effort I lose having to drive myself.
"Yes, but not always.
Nobody likes to drive in traffic, it’s boring, slow and a general waste of time since you can’t do pretty much anything else while driving. I would be very glad if a self driving car could take care of it while I read a book or check emails in the back seat. I’m quite skeptical self driving cars will soon be able to do this kind of urban driving, the problem is that it is necessary to handle very complex situations.
Same goes for highway driving: you just have to keep your foot on the gas and occasionally correct your trajectory, I would really appreciate if a computer could do that for me.
Sometimes however I like speeding a bit or going around a corner fast enough to feel some serious centrifugal force, you know, just to feel some adrenaline. Of course I know this behavior is foolish and potentially dangerous but it’s hard to resist. I also enjoy driving on beautiful roads with lots of corners and suggestive landscapes.
Those are the funny parts of driving and I’m not willing to give them up.","Yes, but not always."

"Yes. There are times when I’m happy not to be the driver, and while self-driving cars will have different failure modes than cars with human drivers, I’m convinced that due to faster reaction times and less likelihood of distraction that driverless cars will eventually be overall safer than those driven by the average U.S. driver.
I also think that the technological changes to make that happen will be in place well before social acceptance.",Yes
"Personally, I would never own a self driving car. The initial outlay will be way out of my range, and the ongoing maintenance will be stuff I am not truly capable of any longer.

"I may own a Tesla some day, but I would likely not use the autonomous / semi-autonomous functions. Even if these functions are accurate 99.9% of the time, when hurtling down the road at speed, that is not good enough. I don't like a system that works most of the time, and then it is expected that I can take over when the system fails.","I may own a Tesla some day, but I would likely not use the autonomous / semi-autonomous functions."

"I don’t think I ever would. Driving has been one of the great pleasures of my lief since the day I got my license on my 16th birthday. Adjusting speed to accommodate a curve or a straightway, downshifting to assist the braking effort, (never owned an automatic, never will) going through the gears is a treat for the senses: sound, the roar the V-8, (never less than V-8), sight - the blur of countryside flying by, olfactory- the smell of the exhaust when you downshift, touch- the feel of that wooden steering wheel, smooth with the patina of years of oils from your hands and taste -that sour taste in your mouth when you almost miss a curve and the fright is more than you experienced in years.

But the reality is we are many, many, many years from that. In the meantime, we have utterly useless systems that are butthole-clenching bad at even basic tasks. The cruise control in my car, the really smart traffic-aware one, randomly stomps the brakes from time to time. On the highway. At full speed. For no reason. It’s so scary I generally only use it on small roads when there’s zero cars behind me. And the “full” driving? Go type that into youtube.
So no, I wouldn’t pay a dime for it in the current state.","I guess that depends: are we talking about the cars we have today, or some mythical future car that can actually do this?"
"Yes, I really would like to have a self-driving car. 95% of my time spend driving is to get from A to B generally in pretty heavy traffic. I’d much rather have my car do that for me leaving me free to prepare for a meeting, eat my breakfast or read a book.
Or just take a nap. I used to leave home at 6 am to get to work at 7 am. I would have loved to be able to sleep that hour.
Now I do love driving when it’s just for the fun of it. So I would still want to be able to drive myself. But like I said, most of the time spend driving is not fun, it’s necessary. Yes, I would want a self-driving car.","Yes, I really would like to have a self-driving car"
"I don’t think so. They have to show that they are reliable even in bad weather or road conditions first. And then I don’t want to be held responsible for mistakes the car makes. No supervision by the driver, no taking over. When the car drives, it drives. When it causes an accident, not my business any more. When it runs over pedestrians, not my business. No discussions, it’s either self-driving or nothing at all.
And I think it’s not worth a 10,000$ extra for me.",I don’t think so
