"I understand that a lot of the issues I raise are personal opinions not shared by others which is why I asked in the first place.

Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.

"The Brave Little Toaster is rated ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.
The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.
The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it.

So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.
It wasn't a made for TV movie, but that's what ended up happening to it.
It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view.
Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it.

So, in conclusion, The Brave Little Toaster isn't underrated as it is rated very highly, but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements haven't aged well.","The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.

" Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway , but  the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations.  
 You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion , but  once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth.  
 Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group.

The emphasis on belief rather than practice.
For most religions, it matters what you do.
When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent.
Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he didn't worship him?
So that sort of gives Christianity a long term advantage: you can do what the encountered religion considers ""good"" but demand small concessions on belief.
It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick.
You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around.
Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans.
It's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily (though that happened sometimes).
It's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they'd want is a little Bible reading.
