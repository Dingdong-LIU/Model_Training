"A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.
The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy.
To see if it actually *is* one (at least the ""republic"" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

Is political power in the US held by elected officials?

Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?

The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously ""yes."" The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution.
And we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail.

You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, but it remains by definition a democratic one.","A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.

The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.

So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.

"There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems.
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower.
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around.
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around.
Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)
**Was view changed?**
Its a complicated issue.
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive?
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?
-(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children.
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower?
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value.
Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment,
i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )
Then there is the next question.
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit?
Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one.
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.
Modern technology like the internet must be considered.
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite.
I am now confused and lost.

The emphasis on belief rather than practice.
For most religions, it matters what you do.
When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent.
Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he didn't worship him?
So that sort of gives Christianity a long term advantage: you can do what the encountered religion considers ""good"" but demand small concessions on belief.
It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick.
You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around.
Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans.
It's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily (though that happened sometimes).
It's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they'd want is a little Bible reading.
