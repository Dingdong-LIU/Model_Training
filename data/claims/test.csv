"> Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person). The ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore just happens to also increase demand for responsibly-grown meat.

"Meat is the industry that creates the most suffering for animals though... Being the one that requires the most land usage and causes the most environmental issues as well as obviously slaughtering them.
