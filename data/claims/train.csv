There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I don't think networking is one of them, the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking.
Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc.
Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which (depending on the job) can often take months.
If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire, that is an extremely bad thing for the business, which means that it's extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires.

"There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems.
Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower.
Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around.
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around.
Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)
**Was view changed?**
Its a complicated issue.
Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?
Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive?
Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?
-(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children.
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower?
This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value.
Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment,
i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )
Then there is the next question.
Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit?
Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one.
This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.
Modern technology like the internet must be considered.

I am now confused and lost.

""33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more.""
So that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.

"While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players.
One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few.
At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance.
Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses.
When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose.
But the game keeps going and going, because it would be ""unfair"" to keep going despite the likely outcome.","While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players."

"The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm won't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing.
Machines don't have money either so they won't bother buying services from us.
Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things, but once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans.
What would be stopping them is the people already in the commutes they would try to go to.

"American patriots have a general mentality against immigration.
Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on.
This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”.
I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations.
As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries.
The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product, but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief.
I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality, but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault.
Patriotism is really just this belief.","American patriots have a general mentality against immigration.
