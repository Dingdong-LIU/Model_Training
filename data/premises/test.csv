285," Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway , but  the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations.  
 You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion , but  once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth.  
 Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group.  
 It's hard enough to change a social norm of violence when it's simply cultural, it's even harder if people have been conditioned to believe that the norm is all that stands in the way of preventing the end of the world or is a persons only way into Valhalla.

For one thing, you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't ""produce"" anything.
You're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.","you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't ""produce"" anything.

365,"You haven't really participated in this thread, but I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.

A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount, (I can name a few that do.)
But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha?
How can he prove he's a firefighter?
Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska?

While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.*

This simplifies the discount process and may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.","A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount

Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering, as their nervous system is sufficiently different from us that I believe we wouldn't know what we were looking for.
However, there are plants that emit pheromones to alert other plants of an impending insect-predator's presence and causes other plants in the area of the same type to activate defenses, and other plants that will actively tense up in response to needle pricks (which, further, will stop responding when exposed to typical anasthetics), which tells me that when plants behave in an animal-like manner, they can and do respond to some sort of pain stimuli.","Carrots get eaten or boiled alive and we have no evidence that suggests, one way or another, if that is causing them suffering
