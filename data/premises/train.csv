109,"Ahh I've seen that article before and it's incredibly flawed.
It boggles my mind it was even published in all honesty.

Livestock animals eat a hell of a lot more crops humans do right?
So if you're really concerned with the damage done by the land use of growing food, then not eating meat would be a great first step to reducing it.

The land required to feed one vegan for a single year is 1/6th of an acre and the land required to feed one meat eater for a year is 18 times more than that.

44,"> I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes.

The only constant is change.
Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts.
The supports necessary for real stability simply don't exist.

To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations.
Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force, and here are two very good arguments for why should be seen as an extreme option:

1) There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up.
With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed.
Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current.

2) Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual.
Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye.
This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected.
It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this.
Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group.","The supports necessary for real stability simply don't exist.

This is a great way to look at it. I come from this all-boy's school background, and I can't shake the feeling of loss when a male friend of mine gets together with a female friend.
I feel like I'm impinging on their relationship whenever I try to interact with the girl because I'm afraid that my male friend will think that there's some ulterior motive involved.

What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship doesn't have to be romantic, yet for some reason I wonder how you've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.

You can choose to not anthropomorphize animals, and, despite how much you love your dog, realize that a chicken is just a chicken, and that your farmed tilapia doesn't have the cognition to question whether it's life is worth living.

I want the animals to be raised humanely, and, yes, I want them to be killed humanely.
But it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys.
No, it thinks more ""food? sex? food?"".

They don't look back and say, ""Man, remember when I bumped into that electric fence?

The best they can manage is ""Fence. Bad.""

There is no ""meaningful"" or ""meaningless"" life for an animal - they don't philosophize beyond needs.
Most farm animals spend less time hungry, scratched by brambles, running from predators, etc than wild animals.
It doesn't make it a better of worse life - it's just existing.

A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.

Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones.
If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.

> (The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.)

Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.

""33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more.""
So that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.
I can't confirm but I do recall reading once that a common reason for women to abort is becoming pregnant too soon after having a child.
It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.

B) Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant

I am not a trained historian, but it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia, and on the fertile crescent's comparatively ancient status as a settled region.

Furthermore, there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children... they're statistically dumber than richer people.
Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence.

3,"> The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces

Most people aren't paid on commission, so this isn't really a good example, but I think I get where you're going with it.

>if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce

But the money doesn't just disappear.
For one thing, you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't ""produce"" anything.
You're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.

Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced.
This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that's where supply and demand are involved.

I'm not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it, but that's more a failure of the system than the system itself.
The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won't sell and will be waste, but that's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.

No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.

If you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient, then no one is going to dispute you, but I will point out that it's the most efficient real system we have.","Most people aren't paid on commission

> There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? 
> It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.

They have only provoked reactions.
North Korea hacked Sony because they are so paranoid and insecure that they can't stand their leader being mocked.
Some Muslims are so irrationally offended and self-important that they believe they have both the imperative and the right to kill people for drawing pictures.
Neither of these examples illustrate problems with the speakers, they show the unhinged reactions of listeners."

123,"You haven't really participated in this thread, but I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.

A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount, (I can name a few that do.)
But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha?
How can he prove he's a firefighter?
Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska?

While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.*

This simplifies the discount process and may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.","A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount

Your OP implied that you thought the purpose of veganism is was to improve animal welfare.
Forgive me if I misinterpreted you.

> that people go vegan/vegetarian for a huge variety of reasons, from personal health to carbon footprint to animal welfare to ethics of eating meat to budget (meat is expensive).

Yes, these are all other reasons that people go into veganism.

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.
There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.
Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.

Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.
There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.","One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.

208,"Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

> There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? 
> It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. 
> The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion.

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit.
I don't think it would kill everybody,  but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.

Glad this has been a productive discussion.
If your view has indeed been changed, please draw your attention to ""The delta (∆) system"" in the sidebar and award me one delta.

The reason I think this is important is because I'm pissed off about the way things are in America, as I'm sure you are, and I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is.
America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy; rather, I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical, and that's exactly what it's turning into.

That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design (even though it can be unfun in some scenarios); it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy.

I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades.
The most beneficial trade I've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving ""immunity"" to that group.
(i.e. Alice has two Yellow properties and one Green property, while Bob has two Green properties and one Yellow property.
Alice agrees to trade her Green for Bob's Yellow, giving them both monopolies, on the condition that Alice won't have to pay if she lands on a Green property and Bob won't have to pay if he lands on a Yellow property).
Players who don't like trades tend to be nervous about giving other players a better position, and I find that they're more inclined to do so if they feel it won't come back to bite them.
Seriously, immunity is great.
Even without auctions, making sure people are aware that they can be ""flexible"" about collecting rent makes the game go much faster.
If you can't sell auctions, this should still help.","If your fellow players absolutely refuse to negotiate, even when it would benefit them in the long run, then the game is not going to be fun.
