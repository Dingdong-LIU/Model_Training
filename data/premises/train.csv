285," Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway , but  the belief eventually becomes the driving force and incentive for the action in later generations.  
 You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion , but  once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth.  
 Many religions have historically encouraged, or even required violence, and once that religion and it's expectation of violence is established, it makes it much more difficult to enact societal change on the group.  
 It's hard enough to change a social norm of violence when it's simply cultural, it's even harder if people have been conditioned to believe that the norm is all that stands in the way of preventing the end of the world or is a persons only way into Valhalla.

34,"While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being, if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique, there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming.
Swimming is:

A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels

B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added

C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems

D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)

More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.

Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art.

certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well.

The emphasis on belief rather than practice.
For most religions, it matters what you do.
When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent.
Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he didn't worship him?
So that sort of gives Christianity a long term advantage: you can do what the encountered religion considers ""good"" but demand small concessions on belief.
It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick.
You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around.
Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans.
It's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily (though that happened sometimes).
It's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they'd want is a little Bible reading.
Well the native faiths don't think reading the Bible is against their religion - they didn't emphasize belief the way Christians and Muslims do.
