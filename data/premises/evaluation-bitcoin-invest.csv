"Bitcoin is pretty useless. But so is gold.
Gold's value comes from its BRAND and scarcity. That brand has taken thousands of years to build.
However, the world is changing fast - one could argue that gold served a physical world well, we now live in a more digital one. The world does move on - I mean, horses were THE mode of transport for THOUSANDS of years - and that ended pretty abruptly.
Now, here's the thing, Bitcoin has gone past a hurdle most of us never thought it would - investment banks are advising their clients to buy it, institutions are buying it, HNW investors are dumping gold and going for it.
This is massive. This is BRAND.
Forget Bitcoin's intrinsic use, no-one ever cared about gold's either, but as more sophisticated investors buy into Bitcoin, which will spur on others, it will entrench itself as digital gold.
Bitcoin survived the crash of 2018, it'll keep surviving every crash for years to come, each time stronger, each time picking up investors that get comfortable with it. It's no currency and will unlikely ever become one, but it is digital gold - a digital store of wealth built on its BRAND, like most stores of wealth.
The total value of all Bitcoins in existence is a paradigm shift away from significantly exceed that of gold's, i.e. US$500k a Bitcoin and staying there for a sustained period.
That paradigm shift seems to be happening.","However, the world is changing fast - one could argue that gold served a physical world well, we now live in a more digital one

"Ahh Bitcoin. Buying one in 2010 at 0.08$ a coin would now make you 14000$ a coin for every coin that you bought. Which means if you invested 100$ into Bitcoins in 2010 they would be worth a whopping 17.5 million dollars today.
Are bitcoins the future? Or are they going to crash and burn?
Instead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I’m going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide.
Flashback no. 1
The Dot com bubble, 2000
Fueled by the rise of companies with a “.com” after their name, the “.com” bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.
Fundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn’t be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.
And like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.
Flashback no. 2
The housing bubble, 2006/2007
After the recession the “.com” bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.
What is the definition of a “bubble” in finance?","It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future"
"Its exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?
Yes, Bitcoin has its pros. It’s unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it’s also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it’s highly volatile.
Look, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.
But I’m going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it. Jamie Dimon has warned against it. Alan Greenspan compared it to gambling in Las Vegas.
If you must invest in it, remember the golden rule of investing - Never invest more than what you’re willing to lose. If you absolutely must, no more than 10% of your portfolio must be invested in risky assets.
Like the famous economist Paul Samuelson once said, “Investing should be like watching paint dry and watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take 100$ and go to Vegas”.
EDIT: I seem to have gotten a lot of backlash for this answer. Guys, I understand were you all are coming from and I agree, 100%. Blockchain IS revolutionary. Cryptos are well designed to be the future of payments, and Blockchain is definitely not going away. But, this itself is not a reason to buy Bitcoin!","It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future

"Venture capitalists have poured tons of money into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Different services and apps enabling the end user are now available for the non-technical consumers. As more products are build and used in the bitcoin ecosystem, the adoption rate for Bitcoins will increase and its demand with it. This mean you can easily turn a few hundred dollars into a few thousand dollars with enough increase in demands.
Through a global transaction network, bitcoins can be sent securely across borders, in any amount, at low costs, as seamlessly as a text message, and without the need for trusted third-parties. Over 100,000 merchants worldwide now accept bitcoin. The number of active wallet addresses on the Bitcoin network continues to grow – a key sign of a vibrant and growing financial ecosystem – while the methods for sending, receiving, and storing bitcoins continue to improve at both the consumer and institutional levels.
The bitcoin protocol provides the most secure system to make online payments and with so many payment processing system creating products for the end user, bitcoins are definitely one of the most secure options to proceed online payments.
Definitely Bitcoin is a very good investment option as profit is guaranteed and for better risk management, investing with Tigriscryptoinvestments.tech can maximize profits as I have gained significantly since I started investing with them.","As more products are build and used in the bitcoin ecosystem, the adoption rate for Bitcoins will increase and its demand with it

"It is unwise not to invest in Bitcoin.
I am not a believer in cryptocurrencies. While I am excited with the prospects of blockchain technology, I think cryptocurrencies that we have today should still belong to laboratory instead of being unleashed to free market. One of the proof cryptocurrencies are not ready yet, is the extremely fluctuating value that solely driven by “demand” and “potential”, instead of real-world implementation.
It is almost certainly in a bubble.
However, let us be frank. Any profitable investment is a good investment.
The value of bitcoin seven years ago was $0.05 and last month it reached $5,000 which means 100,000 times increase in seven years. How does that sound?
Let’s sweep aside any rational arguments : put 1% of your wealth in bitcoins.
If you enter the market earlier, you can “play with house’s money” like I did.
I bought 10 bitcoins two years ago for $350 each. I sold half of it when it reached $2,500 few months back, made $9,000 profit and my money back already. I still possess 5 bitcoins on my wallet but I am already playing with house’s money. If bitcoin price increase in the future reaching $100,000 then I will have $500,000 cash in my disposal. If bitcoin crashes and burns, I don’t care because I already made a lot of profit in the past. I have nothing to lose.
Bitcoin is a very risky investment but also very profitable.
My advice? Again, put 1% of your wealth in bitcoins.","One of the proof cryptocurrencies are not ready yet, is the extremely fluctuating value that solely driven by “demand” and “potential”, instead of real-world implementation.
The value of bitcoin seven years ago was $0.05 and last month it reached $5,000 which means 100,000 times increase in seven years."
"Even if you can only afford 2 bitcoins with 1% of your wealth, go for it. If bitcoin crashes, who cares? You still have 99% of your wealth. If it soars and goes to the moon then you will have something to talk about with your friends in a pub.","One of the proof cryptocurrencies are not ready yet, is the extremely fluctuating value that solely driven by “demand” and “potential”, instead of real-world implementation.

"We continue to feel strong about Bitcoin being the leading indicator for cryptocurrencies. It should be used to determine the trend: up, down, neutral. This is one of the more actionable cryptocurrency predictions for 2019.
However, Bitcoin is not likely the cryptocurrency that will deliver 10-fold returns similar to the previous 7 years.
The underlying reason is that Bitcoin futures will cap the upside potential because, for the first time since Bitcoin’s inception, there is two-sided trading in the Bitcoin market.
That’s why forecasters believe that it is very realistic to expect a Bitcoin price of $25,000 as an upside target, assuming the crypto crash is over. Previous all-time highs will be taken out, but we believe Bitcoin will trade within its ‘bullish band’, not higher.
This doesn’t mean you should not invest in bitcoin. Instead, let experts handle your investment.

"Let’s start with what bitcoin is?
Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009 following the housing market crash. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.
The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies.
There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Ripple. Etc.
Bitcoin is powered by a technology called a blockchain. To understand Bitcoin, you must understand a little bit about the technology in order to make a wise choice for your investment strategy.
A blockchain is a public database that shows all transactions, with user privacy protected by “cryptography”.
There are many types of blockchains, and many types of coins.
Since Bitcoin was created, there have been hundreds of more coins brought to the market, many of which are cheaper, faster, and more efficient.
For example, Litecoin processes at 56 transactions per second. Newer faster blockchains like EOS can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.
In terms of utility, Bitcoin only processes 7 transactions per second.
So you may be wondering, why is the price of Bitcoin so high?
But other coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are catching up.
Bitcoins Are Scarce","It’s possible to see when new bitcoins are created, when a transaction is created, or how many bitcoins are in circulation."
"Bitcoin’s monetary policy is one of its most important features. It’s possible to see when new bitcoins are created, when a transaction is created, or how many bitcoins are in circulation.
Bitcoins can be sent from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world. No bank can block payments or close your account. Bitcoin is censorship resistant money.
Bitcoin makes cross border payments possible, and also provides an easy way for people to escape failed government monetary policy.
The internet made information global and easy to access. A sound, global currency like Bitcoin will have the same impact on finance and the global economy.
If you understand the potential impact of Bitcoin, it won’t be hard to understand why investing in bitcoin may be a good idea.
Bitcoin’s Price
There is no official Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s price is set by whatever people are willing to pay. Buy Bitcoin Worldwide’s is a good resource for the current and historical price.
Bitcoin’s price is generally shown as the cost of one bitcoin. However, exchanges will let you buy any amount, and you can buy less than one bitcoin.
Lower inflation risk. Unlike world currencies — which are regulated by their governments — bitcoin is immune to inflation. The blockchain system is infinite and there’s no need to worry about your cryptos losing their value.
New opportunities. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is relatively young — new coins are becoming mainstream on a daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive gains.","It’s possible to see when new bitcoins are created, when a transaction is created, or how many bitcoins are in circulation.

"Minimalistic trading. Stock trading requires you to hold a certificate or license. You must also go through a broker to trade a company’s shares. But bitcoin trading is minimalistic: simply buy or sell bitcoin from exchanges and place them in your wallet. Bitcoin transactions are also instant — unlike the settlement of stock trading orders, which could take days or weeks.
Disadvantages of Bitcoin Investments
Bitcoin may be the future of monetary exchange, but it is equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding cryptocurrency investing. Here are some serious risks associated with bitcoin investments.","Volatility. The price of bitcoin is always rippling back and forth. If you happened to buy bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn’t sell your investment for more than $7,051. The bitcoin market is constantly changing. With such an unpredictable market, you can hardly get a good return on your investment. To avoid huge loss, keep a close eye on the market.
Threat of online hacking. Hacking is a big threat facing a bitcoin investor. Bitcoin exchanges let you buy and sell your cryptos using a mobile app or website. This leaves them susceptible to hacking and theft of all your investment. And bitcoin held on exchanges isn’t insured by the FDIC.
Little or no regulation. The bitcoin market currently operates with no major regulations. It isn’t taxed and governments have no clear stance on it. As a result, you could stand exposed to fraud and malpractice.
Limited use. Bitcoin is currently only accepted by few online merchants. Many companies don’t also recognize bitcoin as a legitimate exchange, making it an unfeasible investment vessel. Besides, there’s only a fixed supply of bitcoin — 21 million.
Wallets can be lost. If your hard drive crashes or virus corrupts your wallet file, you lose your bitcoins. You can go from a wealthy to bankrupt investor within seconds with no way to recover."

Conclusion: Is it still worth investing in Bitcoin
Many people have been watching Bitcoin for years and wondering if it is still worth it and how to invest in bitcoin wisely. There are many expert opinions all over the internet trying to persuade people in both directions, whether it’s to buy and hold (or “hodl”) or to short it via CFDs.","While many famous people on the internet may tell you different stories, smart investors always advise to never risk more money than you can afford to lose

"Yes, you should. I have been investing in crypto for a while now, seems to have a similar pattern every time and don't look at the market very often now.

"Most people you talk to about cryptocurrencies today believe there’s no more opportunity left; according to them, the ship already left the harbor, without them. There may well be an inkling of truth in that, but there are still more opportunities lying ahead. The dust hasn’t yet settled on this evolving money revolution.
Success… and Not so Successful Stories
If you are hearing about Bitcoin for the first time, simple Google “Bitcoin Success stories” and read about a man who spent $3000 in October 2010 to buy 20,000 at $0.15 each. Come 2013 and Bitcoin made headlines, and the price was $350 (2000 times more than he had spent). He sold 2000 Bitcoin at that price and later sold 2000 more when the price hit $800 to make $2.3 million. He later made many other sell-offs to eventually make $25 million from the initial investment of $3,000
However, every story has two sides. There are also many stories about personal Bitcoin disasters. Read the story of 32-year-old James Howell who accidentally discarded his hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoins; that would be worth $56 million today. Read about Lily Allen turned down a payment of 100,000 Bitcoins for a streaming performance gig on the game second life.
Whether to invest in Bitcoin in 2019 is a hot topic; all the noise surrounding cryptocurrencies could easily cloud your judgment on whether to try this lucrative digital asset. Being such a young asset, the market is volatile, filled with stories of extreme success or a massive failure. The issue at hand, therefore, is about making an educated decision based on timing, probability and whether the investment profile fits you.","There may well be an inkling of truth in that, but there are still more opportunities lying ahead

"Investing and crypto.
First, we need to define what investment is. Investing assumes holding a financial asset for profit purposes for a substantial time. It could be some financial assets that allow investors to get regular payments, like dividends, from it. There are a variety of investment instruments available to ordinary people nowadays.
Only three decades ago, the world of investments belonged to a higher caste of people. The trading process of financial entities was implemented by qualified traders only at special places like Wall Street, London Stock Exchange etc. With the development of the internet, financial markets became accessible to the general public. This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders’ expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result.
The Internet brought us not only trading opportunities. The last decade was a decade of digital currency. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of crypto coins, tokens, and NFTs emerged from nowhere. Some are complete scams, and some are born to vanish in oblivion. But there are definitely names worth our attention for the investing prospects.
Bitcoin and its investing capacity.
For instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide. Among them are:
* Santander;
* SBI Remit;
* Credit Agricole;
* Siam Commercial Bank;
* SEB etc.","When you reduce the amount of some assets, it creates scarcity

It’s no secret that literally all crypto coins and tokens, major or minor, are heavily correlated with Bitcoin price. According to the previous halvings price range, we can predict that the next Bitcoin halving will be followed by a Bitcoin take-off to the $100,000 price tag.
This strategy is not an investment in the broad sense. Trading assumes buying at the lows and selling at the highs. The next Bitcoin 4 year cycle will also consist of two indispensable parts: bullish and bearish. When the bullish part will come to an end Bitcoin assets should be sold.","When you reduce the amount of some assets, it creates scarcity

Bitcoin is currently at its peak when it comes to value, so if you’re wondering should you invest in Bitcoin, the answer is yes. Considering Bitcoin’s current value, you can easily profit from investment. If you have some cash to spare, investing in some cryptocurrency is not a bad idea. You have to learn some ground rules though, such as don’t invest more money than you can afford to lose and choose your investments wisely.","Bitcoin is currently at its peak when it comes to value, so if you’re wondering should you invest in Bitcoin, the answer is yes"

"The “too late” mindset will ruin your investing
psychology and your potential to make enough money to enjoy your life.
Bitcoin has gone mainstream. There are some people who hate me for it.
I’m getting quite a few people all asking me the same question: “Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?”
I don’t think it is. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in a world that is high on worthless currency printed in excess. The only way to fund our excessive lifestyles is to increase the global debt and pay for it with money printed out of thin air.
My approach to bitcoin is different. It’s a little less drastic. I’ve been playing with it for years and have become fascinated by it. The rewards for me understanding bitcoin are now over 17,900%+ on the initial investment.
I don’t think I’ve ever made another investment like it. It’s likely I will never make another investment like it for the rest of my life. There may never be another investment like it.
The unfortunate psychological challenge when you buy something that performs beyond your wildest dreams is you think to yourself, “I should have bought more.” You can always want more and spend more. But it doesn’t matter. Money has never made me happy. The same is likely true for you.
So how do you manage your psychology when bitcoin mania is sweeping the world and it has gone mainstream? How do you cope when it’s trending on twitter, on the front page of every newspaper, being promoted by some of the biggest wall street tycoons in the world, like Paul Tudor Jones?
First, you stay calm.
You’re never late to anything in life. You’re right on time.
Bitcoin is extremely weird",The trouble with bitcoin is it’s not easy to understand. When people don’t understand a concept they quickly dismiss it and call it a scam so they don’t feel stupid.

This means it’s the opposite of everything else you can put your money into. Owning both sides of a marketplace de-risks you. If you only invest your money in one thing, then if that asset has a downturn and never recovers, you lose the lot.Bitcoin is an investment in an unknown, distant future.
Like I said, bitcoin isn’t normal. It confuses people and that’s what it was designed to do.
The worst way to invest as an everyday person is for the short term. One of my early investments in bitcoin was short term. I bought a lot and then sold it when the price crashed in 2017. That short-term thinking has meant I’m working a few years longer than I need to.
I would be retired if I still had all the bitcoin I owned in 2017. I’m okay with that. My investor psychology was weak back then. I needed to see a few 50% drops to learn my lesson. The March 2020 covid crash was certainly a good test, and I passed without selling any bitcoin.","The trouble with bitcoin is it’s not easy to understand. When people don’t understand a concept they quickly dismiss it and call it a scam so they don’t feel stupid.

It’s not time to panic.It’s time to digitally upgrade your financial education.
Physical cash in your wallet and nuggets of gold you take inside with a wheelbarrow is the pre-digital financial world. The world of money is a long way behind advances in technology.

If you’ve been thinking about bitcoin, do your research. Go down the rabbit hole. Avoid FOMO. Stay away from the hype. Understand the problem it solves, intimately. Get to know bitcoin like you would a new lover you invite into your bed to shag.

"This is the best and no other time to invest in bitcoins and double your investments in order to be financially bouyant and have financial freedom in this Covid-19.
Over the past months, the price of bitcoin has been hovering around $9,283.87.
It seems silly to some people that one bitcoin can be worth hundreds of dollars.
What makes bitcoins valuable is because bitcoins are scarce and useful.
Let’s look to gold as an example currency. There is a limited amount of gold on earth.
As new gold is mined, there is always less and less gold left and it becomes harder and more expensive to find and mine.
The same is true with Bitcoin.
If you haven’t invested in bitcoin and yet to consider the option of investing, I urge you to make the choice today and have some financial breakthrough.

"Try thinking of investing in bitcoin as you would buying a lottery ticket. It only costs a dollar, but you could win big. However, as historically shown with commodities, the odds are good that you're going to lose money compared with a low-cost, diversified investment.Bitcoin is open to everyone and provides an exciting opportunity to delve into an entirely new asset class.

"I urge people to please take a look at the following chart of Bitcoin to understand this bubble.
So today 1 Bitcoin is equal to Rs 3425165.13 this is a lot of money. Now in simple terms Bitcoin works on demand and supply only. It has no intrinsic value of its own. So the issue to be looked at here is that what is making the price of Bitcoin to shoot up the way it is shooting up?
Can this price be sustained for long?
Now as you can see from the chart above the price of 1 Bitcoin on March 13, 2020 was Rs 382016.72
So what happened was that as the stock markets were collapsing in March of 2020 the federal reserve followed a reckless money printing strategy and started pumping markets artificially. Money was also given to the citizens of US to survive the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic.
Now during the same pandemic new speculative traders and investors got the chance of a lifetime to try their hand in the world of financial markets i.e. the stock markets, crypto, gold, silver other commodities etc.
So what they did was that based on greed, news, speculation and more speculation these people started pumping the Bitcoin like there is no tomorrow. This was done on hearsay. This was done based on greed and speculation that dollar is now going to be soon replaced.
Hence while the federal reserve was recklessly printing money ill informed and speculative traders were at pumping the Tesla stock and Bitcoin phenomenon like never before that is why the value of Bitcoin just shot up by around 10 times since March 2020.","So today 1 Bitcoin is equal to Rs 3425165.13 this is a lot of money

I told them it would reach at least 10k by 2018 but it reached almost 20k a piece. Thats when they decided to buy bitcoin at 14k when they could have bought it at $350 like I did.

"The favorite Crypto currency of most of the people is Bitcoin, which moved from $0.1 to $40,000 in just ten years. That’s 41362300% which is more than 4 crores % returns, insane ! But let’s analyze last ten years historical data of Bitcoin and check what it takes to Invest in Bitcoin.
Between Sept 2010 to June 2011, Bitcoin raised from $0.1 to $30, that’s 29900% returns in less than one year. That’s the first bull move witnessed in Bitcoin. But just right after that, it crashed back to $2 from $30, that’s 93.3% crash. First crash! Can you Imagine losing more than 90%? That’s the volatility of Bitcoin.
Every crash is followed by big bull run. Same happened with Bitcoin during 2011 to 2013. Moving from $2 to $240 in less than 2 years, that’s 11900% returns. Just after that, it crashed 80%, from $240, it went down to $50 in few months.
Next spectacular move from $50 to $1250, this happened at a very short span of time, April 2013 to Dec 2013. In 8 months, 2400% returns. Remember this the period where BITCOIN gained huge traction, volumes increased higher. But right after hitting $1000 mark, Bitcoin crashed to $100, more than 90% crash in less than 3 months and continued to trade in a range.
It took more than 3 years for Bitcoin to cross its previous resistance level of $1000. But the moment that barrier was crossed, it instantly shot upto $20,000 in less than a year with intermittent small corrections of -15% to -30%. But after that? Yes, extreme volatility came in again.","it took 3 years to break the $20,000 barrier
in year 2020, it broke that resistance level and shot upto $40,000 which was hit recently
Instant 100% rise in less than 3 months"
"BTC came all the way down to $3000, crashed 85% from its peak level and it took 3 years to break the $20,000 barrier. But in year 2020, it broke that resistance level and shot upto $40,000 which was hit recently. Instant 100% rise in less than 3 months.
So should you invest in Bitcoin?
Bitcoin rise of $0.1 to $40,000 did not happen so easily. If you are worried that you missed one of the insane bull run, bubble whatever. Don’t be worried, even people with balls of steel can’t see their investment going down 90%. Invest in Bitcoin, only if you are okay to loss all.

"Buying bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can be a fun way to explore an experimental new investment. But it’s also true that any investment in cryptocurrency should carry a warning label like cigarettes: “This product may be harmful to the health of your finances. Never buy more than you can afford to lose.”
The value of bitcoin — the world’s first and most popular cryptocurrency — has risen from recent lows but is still trading far below 2017 highs. Like all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is experimental and subject to much more volatility than many tried-and-true investments, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
One rule of thumb is to invest no more than 10% of your portfolio in individual stocks or risky assets like bitcoin.

"It's choice. Price of Bitcoins are getting higher & higher each day. Current value of BTC is:
$50431( change as per market)
Now, two days ago, it was 34 Lakh INR.
Bitcoins has made many people millionaire & because of this fact, many people are running for this.
Facts & Reality:
(Bitcoins investment shouldn't be entertained much as its virtual assets. Anyway you can invest at your own risk.)
When Bitcoins was launched initially ,it was priced for $.0008 per Bitcoins. Through years it has been ups & down. Current value of Bitcoins is beyond anyone's imagination.
People want to be rich within day, but it cannot happen in crypto currency because it goes through various phases & many factors are involved in it's growth. Bitcoins is exceptional at growth.
Caution:
Don't invest in Bitcoins if you are looking to be millionaire within day . People who are benefitted are one's who have waited for 7–8 year & made constant purchase.
Trap:
When people buy virtual currency, they influence people to buy more to raise price. Same is with Bitcoins. Everyone knows Bitcoins is “over valued” .","Price of Bitcoins are getting higher & higher each day

"A year ago, cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin rose in value by more than tenfold. But they have lost over 70% of their value over the past several months.
This represents a decrease of over 50% in the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) between the middle of April and the end of July. As of June 20, the price of Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) has plummeted by approximately 57% from its all-time high, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has declined by a total of 69% from its peak value.
Over the past few weeks, however, crypto prices have shown some gains. The price of Bitcoin has risen more than 33% since July 21st. In that same time frame, the price of Ethereum increased by 28%, and Dogecoin increased by 20%.
It looks like the price of cryptocurrency is on the rise, which means it's time to invest. Let's lay out the groundwork.
Is crypto set to rocket again?
Although you missed out on the last cryptocurrency craze, it is still a good time to invest in crypto, especially since this latest market spike follows a strong uptrend. However, a return to record-shattering price levels is not guaranteed.
Think carefully about why you want to invest in cryptocurrency before you do so. Getting rich overnight is a risky endeavor if the only goal is to become wealthy. Not every investment opportunity is a sure bet. Also, if you put a lot of money into an investment that doesn't pan out, that could end up being a costly mistake.
Conversely, if you're interested in buying crypto because you believe it has long-term potential, then it doesn't matter when you buy. A smart long-term investing strategy involves buying only if you plan to hold on to your investments for several years.","Getting rich overnight is a risky endeavor if the only goal is to become wealthy. Not every investment opportunity is a sure bet. Also, if you put a lot of money into an investment that doesn't pan out, that could end up being a costly mistake."
"The system that provides the greatest and most consistent growth for the longest time (AWARDED) One can't be wrong when there are over 23,172 Telegram followers.
Due to your long-term investment strategy, buying today, a month from now, or six months from there will not be a huge difference for you. This means that if Bitcoin has an ultimate value of $500,000 per token, whether you purchased it at $35,000 or $40,000 per token won't matter. You could still earn a lot of money no matter what happens to crypto.
Do you believe in cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency can be a high-risk investment because nobody knows whether it will succeed in the long term. Therefore, if you are a risk-averse investor, you should not consider investing in cryptocurrencies.
There are various safeguards you can put in place when acquiring cryptocurrency, though. Secondly, you can ensure that your portfolio contains a well-diversified collection of strong stocks. Your overall portfolio will remain strong if your crypto investments fail to do well.
Investing money you can afford to lose is also critical. The hard part about investing your entire life savings in cryptocurrency is that it means you will most likely lose it all, but putting a small amount of money into the market that has little impact on your finances will reduce your risk.
Regardless of whether or not you decide to invest in cryptocurrency, it also depends on your investment strategy. Buying now might be a good investment if you can afford it and are able to tolerate high-risk investments. However, there are many other investment opportunities if cryptocurrency isn't for you.
Bitcoin's inherent risks","The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements"
"For one thing, while Bitcoin may have been around for a lot less time than many of the companies that trade on the stock market today, it has been around for a lot less time than a lot of other digital currencies. The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements.
However, there are other risks with Bitcoin as well. It's impossible to predict whether or not this currency will catch on. If this does not happen, demand for the product is likely to decrease. Should Bitcoin demand decrease, the price will fall as well.
As well, there is no guarantee what kinds of regulatory issues may arise with regard to digital currencies such as Bitcoin. Until additional clarity is provided, this is a high-risk proposition.
Investing in Bitcoin isn't necessarily a poor decision because of the risk involved. Is it a good retirement investment? I highly doubt it.
No one can know if Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be part of the global financial system for another decade or more. A lot of people assume that if they are a decade or more away from retirement, it can be very unsettling.
When buying Bitcoin, it is therefore important to follow a few basic rules:
Make sure you invest only a moderate amount of your money in it.
You should be prepared for the possibility that your investment will be lost.
This can be intended to be used for a short period of time only
Investing in stocks should be done on a long-term basis, as the market has a history of rewarding investors who persevere. Cryptocurrency markets do not have any kind of historic precedent.","The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements

"Bitcoin could turn out to be a moneymaking opportunity for you. If that turns out to be your own personal experience, you should take your profits and invest them in a portfolio that will support you in retirement. But, don't hold your breath waiting for an investment in Bitcoin to pay your long-term senior living expenses.","The price of equities is known to fluctuate, but Bitcoin has seen even more extreme price movements

"That’s up to you. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are risky assets, and generally, should not consist of more than a minority position in any well-diversified portfolio.
That being said, has reached significant lows recently, falling as low as slightly above $25,000 this week, though has continued to rebound to the $29,000-$30,000 level as buyers and sellers continue to battle over the price.
With major resistance levels being broken, Bitcoin could end up falling to $20,000, $15,000, or less.
Historically, Bitcoin has rebounded from 3+ market crashes and has often reached new highs, meaning that buying low could be a good option.
However, it could be smart to wait to see just how Bitcoin will go, since it appears that Bitcoin will either remain around $30,000 or trend downward, and seems unlikely to break out above $35,000-$40,000 for at least a few months, if not 1–2 years or more.
This being said, crypto is still an experimental asset. Bitcoin could end up being the Yahoo of crypto, instead of the Google.
Bitcoin, while being the first horse in the crypto race, has little utility as a currency due to its high volatility and, unlike Ethereum, is not built to host dApps, meaning that it has little use other than a store of value, like gold, except, unlike gold, it cannot be used for jewelry or precision electronics.","Even though Ethereum is very slow, many Layer-2s are being built on-top of it that improve its speed and transaction volume
These Layer-2s also need ETH as gas to run their network, which could increase demand for ETH further."
"If you are looking to invest in a large-cap crypto, ETH could be a better choice due to it’s necessity as an currency for conducting transactions on the Ethereum network, which is continually growing its user base. Even though Ethereum is very slow, many Layer-2s are being built on-top of it that improve its speed and transaction volume. These Layer-2s also need ETH as gas to run their network, which could increase demand for ETH further.
Both Bitcoin and ETH are considered the “safest” crypto assets, but they have such large market caps, that if you are looking for a truly explosive asset that will grow 5x, 10x ,or 100x, you are looking in the wrong place.
If you are going to put a part of your portfolio into high-risk with assets that could go to close to zero, there’s an argument that you should attempt to maximize total returns, since your risk is already so high.
Therefore, for maximum probable profit, you may want to consider investing in coins with smaller market caps, say $100-$500 million, or $1 billion maximum. For instance, it’s much easier for a coin to go from $1 billion to $30 billion (30x) than it would be for Bitcoin to go from $600 billion to $18 trillion (also 30x). For reference, $18 trillion is close to the size of the entire U.S. annual GDP for 2021.
Disclaimer: None of this is financial advice, just my personal thoughts.","Even though Ethereum is very slow, many Layer-2s are being built on-top of it that improve its speed and transaction volume
These Layer-2s also need ETH as gas to run their network, which could increase demand for ETH further."
"Bitcoin provides a sound and predictable monetary policy that can be verified by anyone.
Bitcoin’s monetary policy is one of its most important features. It’s possible to see when new bitcoins are created when a transaction is created, or how many bitcoins are in circulation.
Bitcoins can be sent from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world. No bank can block payments or close your account. Bitcoin is censorship-resistant money.
Bitcoin makes cross-border payments possible, and also provides an easy way for people to escape failed government monetary policy.
A global currency like Bitcoin will have the same impact on finance and the global economy.
If you understand the potential impact of Bitcoin, it won’t be hard to understand why investing in bitcoin may be a good idea.
Anyone who bought Bitcoin and held it for five years or more made significant returns on investment. If you bought Bitcoin in December 2015, you could have bought it for 400 USD; if you sold it five years later for 28,828 USD, that would be a 72x gain!
The stock market does not perform like this. Amazon is a success story for stock market traders and it would only give you a 5x gain.
Bitcoin has continuously proven itself to be the greatest investment of the decade.
Before you buy Bitcoin, you need to make sure you are ready for it. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset and if you buy at the top and sell at the bottom, you can lose a lot of money.","The stock market does not perform like this

You have to consider many aspects before investing. There may be some tricks to get success in Bitcoin investing.
Behind The Word Bitcoin
You all are familiar with that Bitcoin is a digital currency. The uniqueness of Bitcoin is a digital asset that serves as a normal currency but without the interrupts of banks. We all know the digital money that we can send from one bank to another. But bitcoin is not like that.
Each bitcoin is created by a set of codes that look like a string of numbers and letters. You have the same code to unlock the asset that is a virtual key.
Should You Invest In Bitcoin
If you have a strong mind to accept the loss, then you may invest your money. First, you have to understand the entire flow of Bitcoin well. Then you have to question yourself that you can do it.
Three things you have to consider before,
1) Don't invest your entire amount, which is not recommended.
2) Always invest a small amount, not so greedy.
3) If the price value gets falls, then don't wait for the entire amount to flush out. At least retire your investment amount.

"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a form of digital currency that uses cryptography for security. Individual Bitcoins are created by computer code, with a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins in existence. Most of the money supply is already here, which means Bitcoin is not inflationary. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency with a fixed supply, meaning that once miners have minted all 21 million bitcoins and the code states no more bitcoins can be mined, then the price of each bitcoin would likely shoot up. Bitcoin is like digital gold. Just like gold has value because it is scarce, so does bitcoin, the digital store of value that can be sent around the world instantly, securely and for free. So, should you invest in bitcoin? If you can, why not?

"If you're wondering whether you should invest in Bitcoin, the short answer is yes. Here's why:
1. Bitcoin is still in its early days. Yes, it's been around for a while now, but the cryptocurrency market is still relatively new and unregulated. This means there are plenty of opportunities for making money with Bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. While this may scare some people off, it also presents a great opportunity for investors who are looking to make quick profits.
3. Bitcoin is decentralized, which means it isn't controlled by any single entity like a central bank or government. This makes it resistant to censorship and tampering, which is a big plus for investors who value sovereignty and freedom.","Bitcoin is still in its early days.

"Bitcoin: Common Mistakes to Avoid and How to Invest in Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a popular digital asset and payment system. Transactions are verified through cryptography and recorded in a public dispersed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique but you need to know to use it and avoid mistakes.
Here are some common mistakes bitcoin rookies make.
1. Understanding and Bitcoin
Many people jump into bitcoin without fully understanding what it is or how it works. This can lead to confusion and frustration. So if you’re new to bitcoin, take the time to learn about it before start using it.
2. Secure and Bitcoin
Like any other digital asset, bitcoin is susceptible to hackers and theft. So it’s important to secure your bitcoin. This includes using a strong password, encrypting your wallet, and backing up your wallet.
3. Buying A Lot Of Bitcoin
It can be tempting to buy a lot of bitcoin when prices are low. But doing this can be risky, especially if you’re not familiar with the market. It’s best to buy bitcoin in small doses and learn about the market before investing more money.
4. Margin Trading
Margin trading can be dangerous, especially for novice traders. When you trade on margin, you’re borrowing money from your broker to increase your buying power. This can lead to large losses if the market moves against you.
5. Not Researching the Coins - Avoid Scams
Before investing in a new coin, do your research and make sure you understand what it is and what it’s trying to achieve. There are a lot of scams out there, so it’s important to be careful when trading coins.","Like any other digital asset, bitcoin is susceptible to hackers and theft.

"No,
The price of Bitcoin is rising because people are not selling it because of its volatile price and future prospects. The people who invested in it promoted it so much that people became enthusiastic about it and everyone wants to buy it but no one wants to sell it. Due to the huge gap between demand and supply, its price has been steadily rising.
It was initially mined by some clever investors and probably built by them too. A lot of money was secretly spent on its promotion. People were told that it was the currency of the future. But even today no one uses it as a currency and no one will in the future. The purpose of every person who buys it is to sell it and become rich in the future when its prices go up.
There will come a time when most people will have invested in it and everyone who has invested in it to get rich will start selling it and then there will be no buyers.
And because of its declining price, no company will accept it as a currency.
This will be the beginning of the Great Depression 2.0, which will be worse than the 1929 recession.","The price of Bitcoin is rising because people are not selling it because of its volatile price and future prospects

"Bitcoin is extremely volatile. If you are willing to take the risk, first make sure you understand what you are investing in and have a crypto investment strategy.
Also make sure you aren’t investing simply because you have a fear of missing out.There are a number of questions you should ask yourself before getting involved:
Do I understand what I am investing in and how bitcoin and the crypto market work?Am I happy with the level of risk?How much more expensive is it now compared to a few months ago? If so, why am I wanting to buy a thing because its price is higher? Where else in my life do I do that?Is there any evidence to suggest prices could rise even higher?If I buy it now with a view to sell it for even more later, who do I think will buy it from me for that higher price and why?If an asset is so great, why was I not interested when it was much cheaper",Bitcoin is extremely volatile.
"Investing in Bitcoin is viable option especially in a view of current decline of the power of Fiat currencies. You can make profits with Bitcoin simply by following a DCA strategy, which is a low-risk strategy suitable to most investors.
You can increase your ROI by participating in Bitcoin mining and/or staking, though at this point mining other crypto currencies is more profitable than concentrating on Bitcoin or Ether.
Keep in mind that cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, so you should be prepared for long-term investing rather than trying to concentrate on quick profit.
Before investing in Bitcoin, think about your storage preferences first. How do you want to store your Bitcoin? is it going to be a hard wallet or a soft wallet. Each of these options have their pros and cons.
With hard wallet, your Bitcoin is safe from hackers, however if you lose your usb drive, then your Bitcoin balance is gone forever. With soft wallets, you can restore your balance providing you have the private key, but at the same time there is a chance your balance could be stolen if either your wallet or the crypto site hosting your wallet are hacked…
None of these options is safe proof. However, keeping your money in Fiat currency is even worse choice. Not only you are getting close to 0 interest rate from banks, but insane inflation will quickly eat up your principal.","You can make profits with Bitcoin simply by following a DCA strategy, which is a low-risk strategy suitable to most investors
