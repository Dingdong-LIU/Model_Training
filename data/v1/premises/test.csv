10,"I want to point out that I absolutely **could not** stand to read the LotR trilogy.
And I tried.
I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.

I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time.

And I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games, because these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore.
I *love* that the extended edition helped with this, especially in this situation, because most of the answers to that on the internet before were ""If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!"" because nerds are like that sometimes.","And I tried.

78,"The Brave Little Toaster is rated ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.
The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.
The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it.

So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.
It wasn't a made for TV movie, but that's what ended up happening to it.
It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view.
Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it.

So, in conclusion, The Brave Little Toaster isn't underrated as it is rated very highly, but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements haven't aged well.","The Brave Little Toaster is rated ""Fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.

Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous.
One thing about censorship : don't you think it's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook ? Should't this sort of thing be stopped ?

> There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society

While this may be true, hasn't the killing of innocents (and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral (outside of wars) ?

We already clamp down on extremism, and potential extremists are actively monitored using existing surveillance techniques.
Is it really that bad to go after them just a little bit more ?

176,"Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare.
(although they likely do want to improve animal welfare) Let me explain:

As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare.
People will always want meat and the market will always provide it.
Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves.
You are correct on this point.

So why do vegans decide to be vegans, if not to directly help animals?

Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement. ""
I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat.""
It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.
If you believe in gay rights, you may decide not to go to chick-fil-a because of your belief.

no, you don't.

If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life.

I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.
There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies.
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the ""not one of us"" (pack) mentality and escalation of ""police state"".

However, I have never posted nudes online.
I'm somewhere in between this spectrum.
I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them).
I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well.

This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to.

It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.
I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.","Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others?

When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.

The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy.
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day.

No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls, and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.

This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same: if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.","As I understand it

The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy.
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day.
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500.

No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls, and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.

My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to ""evangelize"" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.

One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way, like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time.

My point is, there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events, merely throwing together elements because they are related thematically or tangentially.
You're interpretting this as if it is meant to show something ""as it happened"" when art doesn't always work that way.","Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time
