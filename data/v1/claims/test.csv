"Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.
The animation is very solid for being made in the 1980`s and I absolutely love the inanimate objects journey to try and find their master.

"Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions.
My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to ""evangelize"" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)","The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

"As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function.

Example: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.
The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy.
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day.
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500.
Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.
She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls, but the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500.
No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls, and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.

This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same: if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.","waste has to be produced in order for the system to function

"> I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes.

The only constant is change.
Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts.
The supports necessary for real stability simply don't exist.

To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations.
Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force, and here are two very good arguments for why should be seen as an extreme option:

1) There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up.
With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed.
Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current.

2) Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual.
Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye.
This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected.
It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this.
Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group.","The only constant is change.

Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.

Just because you don't find it empowering to post nudes, doesn't mean other people won't.

However, I have never posted nudes online.

I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them).
I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well.

"So recently I've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion.
I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.
For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists.

So, my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.","I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.

"Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

> There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? 
> It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. 
> The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion.

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit.
I don't think it would kill everybody,  but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.
I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.","Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

"Sure, hopefully I can find some sources to support this argument as well, otherwise I may have to change my mind!
[http://juneauchoice.com/whohasabortions.htm](Here is a well sourced link to some stats about women who have abortions)
Some stats for example include ""31% of women obtaining abortions are in school; 68% of women who have abortions are employed.""
""33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more.""
So that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.
I can't confirm but I do recall reading once that a common reason for women to abort is becoming pregnant too soon after having a child.
It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.

This just won't help the situation in any way.

Neither things are as cool as fighting Russians out of a moral sense of duty, but they're far more effective.

You should not underestimate how threatened Russia feels by the West's expansion into what used to be a buffer zone.

"Ahh I've seen that article before and it's incredibly flawed.
It boggles my mind it was even published in all honesty.

Livestock animals eat a hell of a lot more crops humans do right?
So if you're really concerned with the damage done by the land use of growing food, then not eating meat would be a great first step to reducing it.

The land required to feed one vegan for a single year is 1/6th of an acre and the land required to feed one meat eater for a year is 18 times more than that.

"Yeah, but my point is that giving money to people that have successful children is going, ultimately, to lead to giving money to people that already have money, and withholding it from ones that don't.

Unless you make the reward high enough to overcome the *reasons* that poor parents are less involved (e.g. they don't have time because they are having to work 2 jobs just to support the children), it's not going to solve the problem.
And that's going to be very expensive.

Furthermore, there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children... they're statistically dumber than richer people.
Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence.

It would seem that a better approach would be to pay parents to attend training on how to be better parents, rather than rewarding the ones that have just happened to figure it out on their own.

But honestly, I think you're just being naive about actual statistical variation in native intelligence.
There's really no reason to believe that every person has exactly the same potential to succeed well in school.
A simpler explanation is that native intelligence is probably normally distributed, like almost every other trait people possess."," Yeah

"While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being, if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique, there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming.
Swimming is:

A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels

B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added

C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems

D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)

"As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function.

Example: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss.
The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy.
The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day.
At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500.
Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each.
She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls, but the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500.
No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls, and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.

This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same: if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.","waste has to be produced in order for the system to function
items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away."
