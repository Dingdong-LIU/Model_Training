Also, please forgive me if this is wrong or arrogant or whatever, I want the respect that people give men and women in the military.

My mom doesn't want me to join for that reason.

"Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time.
In other words, events that happen at different points in the narrative are depicted as occuring side-by-side without consideration for *when* and *where* they actually happened.
For instance, Jesus might be depicted as both a child and an adult in the same image.

One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way, like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time.

My point is, there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events, merely throwing together elements because they are related thematically or tangentially.

"Firstly, IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect.
Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible.

It may also be important to note that your system isn't only difficult to implement like you point out, it's also in direct conflict with how things actually work.
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.

Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test.

"American patriots have a general mentality against immigration.
Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on.

"I'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is.
But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated.

Businesses are and should be designed to be effective.
Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal.
Any company/society which encourages business practices that are not effective will quickly be out-competed by one that is effective, and having effective businesses in a society in general improves the quality of life of the people living there.
There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I don't think networking is one of them, the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking.
Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc.

A) Had a group of religions identical in all respects to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam developed in pretty much any area other than the middle east, they would be no more successful than any of the other relatively minor faiths out there today, depending on what the location in question actually was

B) Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant

I am not a trained historian, but it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia, and on the fertile crescent's comparatively ancient status as a settled region.

I would love a better measure of intelligence.

Again, I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence.
(better than SAT scores, right?)

And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for ""da murder"" if we were to take that route in the first place.
(instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever)
The ""number of mental retardation"" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too, so I don't see your point there.
In total, everyone's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter...

I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the ""not one of us"" (pack) mentality and escalation of ""police state"".

[This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479151) shows that unprocessed meat is not linked to heart disease, but processed meat is.
I would also argue that a vegan *has* to be more conscious about their diet, and that extra attention results in health benefits.

Many people consider fish to be extremely healthy, and often include it in their ""vegetarian"" diets.
Eating fish has been associated with a *reduced* risk of heart disease.
Fish farms are equally as cruel as the rest of the meat industry, but we don't relate to them as much so they don't tug on our morals.

Certainly, you can still be healthy with alternative diets.
However, you have to curate your diet much more if you do not include meat. I'm not convinced that an equally curated diet including meat would not be healthier.","This doesn't really matter if it is something that is necessary.

I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.

I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with ""Harry Potter and the..."" but that's an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time.

And I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games, because these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore.

My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to ""evangelize"" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.

"> The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces

Most people aren't paid on commission, so this isn't really a good example, but I think I get where you're going with it.

>if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce

But the money doesn't just disappear.
For one thing, you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't ""produce"" anything.
You're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.

Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced.
This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that's where supply and demand are involved.

I'm not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it, but that's more a failure of the system than the system itself.
The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won't sell and will be waste, but that's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.

No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.

I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.
There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies.
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the ""not one of us"" (pack) mentality and escalation of ""police state"".

My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to ""evangelize"" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.

That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design (even though it can be unfun in some scenarios); it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy.

I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades.
The most beneficial trade I've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving ""immunity"" to that group.
(i.e. Alice has two Yellow properties and one Green property, while Bob has two Green properties and one Yellow property.
Alice agrees to trade her Green for Bob's Yellow, giving them both monopolies, on the condition that Alice won't have to pay if she lands on a Green property and Bob won't have to pay if he lands on a Yellow property).
Players who don't like trades tend to be nervous about giving other players a better position, and I find that they're more inclined to do so if they feel it won't come back to bite them.
Seriously, immunity is great.
Even without auctions, making sure people are aware that they can be ""flexible"" about collecting rent makes the game go much faster.

Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement. ""
I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat.""
It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.
If you believe in gay rights, you may decide not to go to chick-fil-a because of your belief.
Do you really believe that you not giving business will help in any way?
no, you don't.
You just want to make a statement.

TL;DR: You are correct, but you misinterpret the true motivation of vegans

Hope that helps.","Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare
they likely do want to improve animal welfare
As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare.

"Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count.
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?

I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population.
I don't think its feasible, though...

Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are)

We don't know all, true, but we know some, which should be enough to increase intelligence.

Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest...
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have posted this topic.

"Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

> There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? 
> It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. 
> The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQrYCacrKo&spfreload=10

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit.
I don't think it would kill everybody,  but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.
I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.","Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

This is a great way to look at it. I come from this all-boy's school background, and I can't shake the feeling of loss when a male friend of mine gets together with a female friend.
I feel like I'm impinging on their relationship whenever I try to interact with the girl because I'm afraid that my male friend will think that there's some ulterior motive involved.

What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship doesn't have to be romantic, yet for some reason I wonder how you've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.
I hope that's not a bad thing to wonder--I just thought that if you get that close with someone, they might be for you.","What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship doesn't have to be romantic

"Thinking about today's news: [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-30710777), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting)

I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.
There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies.
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries.
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the ""not one of us"" (pack) mentality and escalation of ""police state"".
Change my view.

Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.
It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

"For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities; IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population.

With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).
A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.
I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.(maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below.)

I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children.

"A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.
The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy.
To see if it actually *is* one (at least the ""republic"" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

Is political power in the US held by elected officials?

Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?

The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously ""yes."" The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution.
And we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail.

You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, but it remains by definition a democratic one.","A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.
